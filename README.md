### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Engineer !

I am working with Python (Masonite and Django), Vue.js and Tailwind CSS mainly.

Right now, I am contributing to [Masonite](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/) Python web framework, it looks promising :rocket: !!
- [masonite](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/masonite/) (and future Masonite 4)
- [masonite-orm](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/orm/)
- [masonite-inertia](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia/)
- [masonite-js-routes](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-js-routes/)

(In Progress)
- masonite-admin (An admin panel for Masonite 4 apps)
- others to come ... ðŸ˜€
