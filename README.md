### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Engineer !

I am working with Python (Django, Flask) and Node.js/Vue.js/Tailwind CSS mainly, but I look forward to work on projects with [Masonite](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/) Python web framework, it looks promising :rocket:

Right now, I am focusing on new ideas and on Masonite contributions !
